# Hi üëã, I'm Enzo Daren B. Padual

My passion for technology fires me up in understanding and developing something around the system administration/network administration field since I aspire to be a prospective one. Despite the fact that as yet I am merely a novice in Switching, Routing, and Wireless Essentials, I gained substantial knowledge in my current year of study. So far, I‚Äôve acquired practical experience on how to implement both software and hardware systems which have enabled me to handle projects blending these ideas. I am still committed to continuing in technology learning, and I want to improve on system administration to cope with future improvements in technology.

# Learnings

## üßë‚ÄçüíªScripting and Automation

Scripting and automation in the system administration confront the difficulty of repeated, strenuous work. Most often, the tasks related to management and maintaining system are automated by a means of using script languages like Python, BASH or PowerShell that system administrators apply.

## üõúüöÜNetwork Administration

Switching technologies needed for maintaining SMN are covered by network administration, which concentrates on them. Here, we are talking about the management of WLAN together with an overall view on different security concepts to maintain a reliable functionality as well as protection against misuse of network facilities.

# Reflection:
The completion of these tasks and activities, as well as the big examination, has left me eager. The passionate approach I've been adopting has been the best decision I've made while taking this course. This compilation serves as my determination as I complete this course and progress to the next level of understanding about this subject. The information and skills I've gained will serve as my foundation while I pursue the profession I want after graduation. This website will serve as a record of my efforts as I go on to the next chapter of my book.
